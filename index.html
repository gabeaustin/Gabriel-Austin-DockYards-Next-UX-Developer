        May 17, 2022 Dear DockYard Hiring Manager, I see that DockYard is
        looking for a UX Developer who lives and breathes HTML and CSS. You can
        stop the search because I think you have found the right person. I am an
        individual who enjoys learning new things and implementing new
        technologies that I’ve learned. I have a long-term goal of becoming a
        Project Manager, so having the ability to assist in scoping, estimating,
        and planning projects is ideal. Something that stuck out to me about
        DockYard is the fact that you learn, teach, and mentor. These are
        qualities I am looking for with a company. I believe when you teach, you
        learn. Before returning to developing I taught Computer Science to
        middle school students. Although I was the teacher, this experience
        taught me patience, empathy, and how to relay technical information to
        non-technical audiences. These skills, along with my technical skills,
        make me a great fit for this role. To expound on my technical skills: •
        I am proficient in HTML5 and CSS3; • I am comfortable writing CSS
        without a framework; • I am an outstanding communicator; and • I have
        extensive knowledge and experience with Git and effectively working on a
        remote team. I think this is an excellent opportunity and I would enjoy
        being a part of the curious, diverse, ever-growing culture that your
        company has created. Thank you for your time and consideration. I can be
        reached by email (gabriel.austin2019@gmail.com) or by telephone
        (917-721-7722). I look forward to hearing from you. Regards, Gabriel
        Austin
