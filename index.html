        <div>Dear DockYard Hiring Manager,</div>
        <div>
          I see that DockYard is looking for a UX Developer who lives and
          breathes HTML and CSS. You can stop the search because I think you
          have found the right person. I am an individual who enjoys learning
          new things and implementing new technologies that Iâ€™ve learned. I have
          a long-term goal of becoming a Project Manager, so having the ability
          to assist in scoping, estimating, and planning projects is ideal.
        </div>
        <div>
          Something that stuck out to me about DockYard is the fact that you
          learn, teach, and mentor. These are qualities I am looking for with a
          company. I believe when you teach, you learn. Before returning to
          developing I taught Computer Science to middle school students.
          Although I was the teacher, this experience taught me patience,
          empathy, and how to relay technical information to non-technical
          audiences. These skills, along with my technical skills, make me a
          great fit for this role.
        </div>
        <div>
          To expound on my technical skills:
          <ul>
            <li>I am proficient in HTML5 and CSS3;</li>
            <li>I am comfortable writing CSS without a framework;</li>
            <li>I am an outstanding communicator; and</li>
            <li>
              I have extensive knowledge and experience with Git and effectively
              working on a remote team.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          I think this is an excellent opportunity and I would enjoy being a
          part of the curious, diverse, ever-growing culture that your company
          has created. Thank you for your time and consideration. I can be
          reached by email (<a href="mailto:gabriel.austin2019@gmail.com"
            >gabriel.austin2019@gmail.com</a
          >) or by telephone (917-721-7722). I look forward to hearing from you.

        <div>Regards, Gabriel Austin</div>
